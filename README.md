# Datasets
## Transfer learning in NLP:
* [Amazon review benchmark dataset](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/): sentiment analysis for four kinds (domains) of reviews: books, DVDs, electronics, kitchen
* [ECML/PKDD Spam Filtering](http://www.ecmlpkdd2006.org/challenge.html#download): emails from 3 different inboxes, that can represent the 3 domains.
* [20 Newsgroup](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/): collection of newsgroup documents across 6 top categories and 20 subcategories. Subcategories can play the role of the domains, as describe in [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01217.pdf).
## Named Entity Recognition in Biomedical Domain:
* [BioNLP corpus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/bionlp/Data/)
* [BC2GM](https://omictools.com/bc2gm-corpus-tool)
"Provides a corpus of scientific texts, used for BioCreative, a competition in which participants are given well defined text-mining or information extraction tasks in the biological domain. BC2GM-corpus consists mainly of the training and testing corpora from BioCreative I and the testing corpus for the current task consists of an additional 5,000 sentences that were held 'in reserve'."
* [BioNLP09](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-1401.pdf)
* [NCBI-disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Dogan/DISEASE/)
* [BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation Extraction (BC5CDR)](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-v/track-3-cdr/)
"Description
BC5CDR corpus consists of 1500 PubMed articles with 4409 annotated chemicals, 5818 diseases and 3116 chemical-disease interactions."
