## Datasets
* [Amazon review benchmark dataset](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/): sentiment analysis for four kinds (domains) of reviews: books, DVDs, electronics, kitchen
* [ECML/PKDD Spam Filtering](http://www.ecmlpkdd2006.org/challenge.html#download): emails from 3 different inboxes, that can represent the 3 domains.
* [20 Newsgroup](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/): collection of newsgroup documents across 6 top categories and 20 subcategories. Subcategories can play the role of the domains, as describe in [this article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01217.pdf).
